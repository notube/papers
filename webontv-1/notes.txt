For a healthy Web/TV future:

* share, discovery and annotate functions must not be tied to one platform
* content identifiers and basic metadata should be public and re-usable
* remote control functionality must not be tied to one platform 

Building interactive social TV interfaces is hard; sharing that work is 
critical. To do this, there are basic pieces that should be part of the 
shared landscape. We propose the following as a good start on the pieces
that should be common.

So what do we believe around here?? (1) That if you don't agree simple 
ways of identifying and describing "TV-related stuff", then social, 
interactive, augmented TV experience will be fragmented into proprietary 
islands (2) "TV-related stuff" extends to everything that TV content can 
be *about* (people, places, topics) as well as the pieces that make up 
the content (video/audio streams, subtitles, annotations, overlays and 
links) (3) interaction designers have better things to do than learn 5 
different platform APIs; if we want voice, gesture, multi-touch, 
smartphone and so on as interfaces to TV, we need some common 
abstractions that expose both the things a TV-like-platform can do 
("play a stream, pause a stream...") but also the content it has 
available (playlists, catalogues). (4) basic broadcast metadata should 
be accessible to everyone in open and rich form (including stable 
identifiers), since without it, content won't be easy to link (to people 
who'll tune in, or within archives after broadcast), or to find; and 
content that isn't findable is a waste of a lot of people's money and 
time. <- off top of my head list-ette

[05/01/2011 17:12:35] Dan Brickley: common goals for paper:

[05/01/2011 17:12:45] Dan Brickley: *stuff we want tv people to notice, 
and w3c people to do*
[05/01/2011 17:12:57] Dan Brickley: so more position paper than 
workshop-at-a-conf in tone
[05/01/2011 17:13:04] Libby Miller: should mention stuff we've been doing
[05/01/2011 17:13:05] Libby Miller: imo
[05/01/2011 17:13:07] Dan Brickley: maybe brief survey of the kinds of 
api that are pertinent
[05/01/2011 17:13:07] Libby Miller: too
[05/01/2011 17:13:09] Libby Miller: but yes
[05/01/2011 17:13:12] Dan Brickley: yeh, ground it in the work
[05/01/2011 17:13:22] Dan Brickley: oauth for web-based
[05/01/2011 17:13:29] Libby Miller: feel free to start a new version, if 
you get to it before me https://github.com/notube/papers/tree/master/webontv-1
[05/01/2011 17:13:36] Libby Miller: notes are in notes.txt
[05/01/2011 17:13:42] Dan Brickley: i can write a parag on things like 
websockets/xmpp/locallink
[05/01/2011 17:13:55] Libby Miller: I'll probably take a copy to look at 
between 10-12 GMT tomorrow
[05/01/2011 17:14:41] Dan Brickley: maybe a kind of landscape sketch as 
problem statement
[05/01/2011 17:15:01] Libby Miller: I'm sure apis of some sort are the 
way to go because they make a lot of stuff much easier
[05/01/2011 17:15:06] Libby Miller: and boxee etc doing it already
[05/01/2011 17:15:10] Libby Miller: well xbmc anyway
[05/01/2011 17:15:27] Libby Miller: and the tv stuff atm is nutty
[05/01/2011 17:16:29] Dan Brickley: eg. Alice uses Apple TV, Bob uses 
New MS TV thing, Charlie has a BBC YouBox, Dan has a Boxee box, Erica 
has an AppleTV, Frederico has a Google TV, George prefers GoogleTV, ... 
and they all use a dozen other web sites with audio and TV content, or 
that otherwise know things about them; book club sites, travel sites, 
....
[05/01/2011 17:16:38] Dan Brickley: ...not to mention friends and family 
of each have made their own choices
[05/01/2011 17:16:44] Libby Miller: inded!
[05/01/2011 17:17:01] Dan Brickley: so things to note: some of these 
choices are expensive and hard to change, unlike pure-Web, you got the 
damn box in your living room
[05/01/2011 17:17:23] Dan Brickley: similar choices with phones (and 
less common, tablets; bit sci-fi- other display and touch devices, incl. 
tables)
[05/01/2011 17:17:43] Libby Miller: 
http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2011/01/03/what-the-hell-is-going-on-with-tv/
[05/01/2011 17:17:56] Dan Brickley: another note: the trend to move from 
desktop apps to web players, eg. as joost and iplayer both did, adds 
different constraints w.r.t. 12 foot mode / remote controls
[05/01/2011 17:18:45] Dan Brickley: W3C's goal should be to protect the 
consumer from competition, without holding back progress
[05/01/2011 17:19:11] Dan Brickley: and the motivation is partly that 
social exploration and discovery will be critical to having an enjoyable 
experience and surfacing content from huge collections
[05/01/2011 17:19:37] Dan Brickley: and for the market to produce 
excellence in tv products, we don't want people locked into mediocre 
products simply 'cos their friends are also
[05/01/2011 17:19:53] Dan Brickley: so we need freedom for people to 
switch freely and use the same remote, have the same recommendation 
network, ...
[05/01/2011 17:20:05] Libby Miller: sounds good to me
[05/01/2011 17:20:26] Dan Brickley: re google, I know someone very slightly in their tv group, http://cwilso.com/2010/12/13/six-weeks-at-google/
[05/01/2011 17:20:39] Dan Brickley: i asked him in comments, 'Sounds 
like a fun job! ”’when they’re sitting 10 feet away from their screen, 
and interacting with a “remote control””’ Do you have any mechanism yet 
for 3rd party apps/content to live on second screens (tablets, 
smartphones, eventually table surfaces) rather than clutter up the 
telly? At Joost (RIP) we had on-screen HTML/js widgets, but they always 
came between the viewer and the real content. These days bringing the 
widgets to a smaller nearer screen seems more appropriate, but there’s 
not a lot yet by way of standard communication channel between the 
devices… '
[05/01/2011 17:20:48] Dan Brickley: Not yet. We’ve got a pretty powerful 
remote app, but pairing multiple screens is hard to do flexibly with p2p 
networking (e.g. WebSockets) in the web platform, and if you make a 
native (e.g. Android) app, you’re limiting the user scenarios (i.e. if I 
have a Google TV but an iPhone). I think we’ll get what we need in the 
web platform, but it may take another year or so.
[05/01/2011 17:30:14] Dan Brickley: how about a "What's wrong with this 
picture" grid
[05/01/2011 17:30:22] Dan Brickley: with devices/services down the left, 
users across the top
[05/01/2011 17:30:37] Dan Brickley: an X for where bob has an iphone, or 
alice has an appletv
