1. social is the future for TV?

well, is it? or could it be?

2. silo-isation is happening now

* set top boxes
* social networks
* remotes

3. consumers lose

* do we have to use the same hardware to particpate?

4. manufactuers lose

* support everything? bet on one?

5. key problems 

 "how do we know what the person is watching?", "how do we get extra information about that?", "how can we manipulate it -- buttons protocol, etc.?", "how do we locate apps/web pages/whatever related to it?"
 
 experimental solutions around here being a) nowp, b) tvnds+prog ontology, c) buttons & remote protocol whatnots, d) see (b)

6. demands

* rethink metadata. URIs for the content items (in various versions/flavours; could plug the progs. onto?); but also rethink role of metadata: model it after rss/atom, as a syndication feed format, an advert that flows out into the public Web in search of viewers; and that the values of metadata fields should where possible also be URIs (eg. Wikipedia pages, IMDB pages) so matching becomes easier (eg. against Facebook social graph LIKEs)

7. results

and if person A watched content X1 on a boxee, and person B watched it on -say- Youtube, ... how to help computers (who are really dumb, let's be clear) realise it was the same stuff --> better recommendations, both social via activitystreams and algorithmic - counting stuff

so once you've got your unique, dereferenceable, URI, what can you do with it? what applications can you enable that 'grab the News at Ten app from the App Store' can't?

'avoid them having to make that trip to the App Store in the first place, because they probably wouldn't bother' is one
